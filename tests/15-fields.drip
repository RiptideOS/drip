//! This example showcases how built-in types also support field accesses like
//! user defined structures. Since the str type is just implemented internally
//! as a struct with ptr and len fields, it can be operated on in the same
//! manner. This behavior might be replaced with methods later.

fn main()  {
    let a = "this is a string";

    print("Pointer: 0x{}, Length: 0x{}\n", a.ptr, a.len);
}
